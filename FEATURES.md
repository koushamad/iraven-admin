## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure Go 1.23+ is installed
go version

# Ensure PostgreSQL is running with iraven database
psql -U postgres -d iraven -c "SELECT version();"
```

### 2. Configuration
```bash
# Copy and edit configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit config.yaml with your database credentials
```

### 3. Run
```bash
# Development
make run

# Or directly
go run cmd/admin/main.go

# Production
make build
./bin/iraven-admin
```

### 4. Access
- URL: `http://localhost:8081`
- Email: `admin@iraven.io`
- Password: `KOKOLI**` (change immediately!)

## Architecture Highlights

### Clean Architecture Layers
1. **Handlers** (pkg/handlers/) - HTTP request handling
2. **Models** (pkg/models/) - Data structures
3. **Database** (pkg/database/) - Database connection
4. **Middleware** (pkg/middleware/) - Cross-cutting concerns
5. **Config** (pkg/config/) - Configuration management

### Template Organization
- `layouts/` - Base layouts
- `dashboard/` - Dashboard pages
- `users/` - User management pages
- `roles/` - Role management pages
- `applications/` - Application management pages
- `content/` - Content management pages
- `system/` - System monitoring pages
- `supabase/` - Supabase browser pages

### Scalability Considerations
- Connection pooling for database
- Stateless architecture (session in cookies)
- Horizontal scaling ready
- Cache-friendly design
- Template pre-compilation support

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance
- Page load: < 100ms (local)
- Database queries: < 50ms average
- Concurrent users: 100+ (with default pool size)
- Memory usage: ~50MB idle
- Binary size: ~15MB

### Optimization Opportunities
- Add Redis for session storage (higher concurrency)
- Implement query result caching
- Add CDN for static assets
- Compress responses with gzip middleware
- Implement lazy loading for large tables
